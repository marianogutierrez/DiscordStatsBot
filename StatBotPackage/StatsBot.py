# A Bot is a subclass of Client that adds a little bit of extra functionality 
# that is useful when youâ€™re creating bot users. For example, a Bot can 
# handle events and commands, invoke validation checks, and more.
# 
# NOTE: This stats bot file will load and reload user data automatically.
# This data will be obtained from the json that it will load and dump onto.
# All json logic lies in the CoreFunctions.py Cog.
