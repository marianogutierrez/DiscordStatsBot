# A Bot is a subclass of Client that adds a little bit of extra functionality 
# that is useful when youâ€™re creating bot users. For example, a Bot can 
# handle events and commands, invoke validation checks, and more.
# 
# NOTE: This stats bot file will load and reload user data automatically.
# This data will be obtained from the json that it will load and dump onto.

# statsbot.py
#TODO: Refactor loop to use the on_member_change function instead. This would
# Be more accurate. 
# No need to have locks, but it might be helpful later on to include them
# as if more fucntionality is added, then having locks will
# ensure there are no race conditions.
